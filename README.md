# Unitag - proposed solution

The proposed solution for the exercise exposes the following endpoint:

- `GET /:code`
  - If `code` it is a valid code, this call re-directs to the configured URL for that code. 
  - Possible errors:
    - 400 Bad Request, if code has the wrong format
    - 404 Not Found, if code does not exist
    - 500 Internal Server Error, for any other unexpected error

## Tests
I have implemented unit tests for the parser, service and handler layers. 

I have used the third party library `github.com/vektra/mockery` to generate mocks for the interfaces, which can be generated by running the command
```bash
go generate ./...
```
In order to run the existing unit tests, you can execute the command
```bash
go test ./...  
```

## Running the application
The application can be run by executing the following command from the base directory of the project:
```bash
go run .  
```

Once the application is running, it can be tested by going to the browser and typing the url: `http://localhost:8080/r7TH8k`
